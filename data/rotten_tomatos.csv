0,Brimming with energy and spirit.,positive
1,"If it's not as emotionally haunting as Au Hasard Balthazar or Mouchette, it remains a powerful, compelling portrait of discipline, and humanity.",positive
2,"It does finally achieve its apparent aim: to tempt Miscavige's minions a little further towards the light, the better for us to witness their words and deeds, and thereby grasp the peculiarity of this particular credo.",positive
3,The film is tonally assured enough to render a literal reading somewhat unnecessary since it so purely channels the joy that drives its main character.,positive
4,The proverbial sun has set with enough grace to make us all feel a little apologetic for the doubt we all had on the character who was a champ well before he was ever a champion.,positive
5,"If Trainwreck frosts its cake with a you-have-to-laugh-or-you-would-be-crying-all-the-time icing, you can still taste that sadness in nearly every bite.",positive
6,Few performances are hardy enough both to blossom in the dark intimacy of live theater and bloom under the glaring eye of a movie camera. Ghostlight is not the exception.,negative
7,Resident Evil Vendetta takes the best aspects of the video game high points and makes an amazingly intense and action-packed thrill ride.,positive
8,"A star is born, albeit at the ripe age of 44, as the writer, director, producer and actress Radha Blank seizes her moment, often hilariously so, as the deadpan centre of this whip-smart comedy.",positive
9,"Anderson may yet be the heir to the screwball-comedy throne, but his creative blood needs a fresh infusion.",negative
10,"The sort of quirky, insiderish L.A. dramedy that tries but fails to make us care about its troubled young characters who are, you guessed it, looking for happiness.",negative
11,"If the 3D is passable and there are some moments of tension, Sanctum has big problems.",positive
12,Fans of cinematic dread should seek it out immediately.,positive
13,"Set to the operatic background score of an Old Spice commercial, all the emotional manipulation gets in the way of inspiration.",negative
14,"By messing with the geography of the apartment and the identities of its characters, The Father makes us see and digest and experience the frighteningly unsystematic loss of mental control.",positive
15,"The contrast between their menacingly macho appearance (due to their muscles and military gear) and their tenderness is endlessly endearing, and the film leans into this for our greatest delight.",positive
16,"Cheesy special effects, under drawn characters, simplistic writing (by a committee of scribes) and music video direction will likely draw the attention-deficit crowd",negative
17,"Even if the film itself is relatively conventional, its exposure of a squalid city's most benighted neighborhood and its introduction of hope into nearly hopeless lives give it strong human interest value.",positive
18,"Proof is a stirring motion picture that challenges our views on a great many things about life, some of which we take for granted.",positive
19,"Aside from a few mild swipes at the commercial film industry and New York pseudo-intellectual circles, the film is rather toothless.",negative
20,"The movie offers nothing new to the zom-com sub-subgenre, but has just enough solid laughs to warrant a watch.",positive
21,"Richard Donner directs more for speed than mood, but there are a few good shocks.",positive
22,"Bull Durham, the new baseball movie starring Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon, eases up on you, lazy as a cloud, and carries you off in a mood of exquisite delight.",positive
23,Stewart captures the essence of being in an oppressive environment.,positive
24,"Smarter than Tarantino, cleverer than Carnahan -- literary minded and violent and wickedly funny.",positive
25,One of the best thrillers to come along in a while.,positive
26,"Like Bellocchio's draggy, overrated Vincere, this movie wants us to believe in its depth, while mostly just skimming the surface.",negative
27,"Emotional, occasionally funny, and narratively unpredictable... I doubt any other blockbuster will manage to surpass Black Panther this year. [Full review in Spanish]",positive
28,"The movie offers a terrific playground for Mendes and Hawke to mess around in as these gleefully flawed, cartoonish and yet ultimately dimensional characters.",positive
29,"Turning his camera on works of art and the people who steer the distinguished London complex, the grand old man of hands-off documentaries studies paintings and bears witness to staff meetings, curatorial discussions and gallery talks.",positive
30,"The intention of both the writer, Shaun Grants, and director, Justin Kurzel, was to shed a light on the whys and wherefores of a person like Nitram. I don’t think they did.",negative
31,"Almost completely uninvolving, as well as being impenetrable.",negative
32,"An intriguing premise and bizarre opening show potential, but the film chooses the least interesting direction possible when it veers off on its road trip.",negative
33,"Wow, this movie is totally insane.",positive
34,"Lovely, well-acted with great set pieces, but edited into something choppy and less satisfying than one would hope",positive
35,"Even if it answers questions about Cruella de Vil that nobody ever really had, this runway is all slay, all day. This is the glam slam villain jam we didn't know we needed.",positive
36,Douglas is a maddeningly inconsistent stand-up special...,negative
37,"Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.",negative
38,you'll be wishing they'd just call it quits,negative
39,"Pictorially and musically, the film is distinguished, and if the atmospheric continuity tends at one stage to become wearisome, the humor and philosophy of [the characters] amply compensate.",positive
40,Brunker and his co-writers find a way to deliver a multi-layered story that can grab toddlers while keeping older viewers entertained and not groaning at some propagandized messaging.,positive
41,"Blake Edwards' outrageous S.O.B. may never be held in the same regard as Sunset Boulevard or The Player, but as a searing satire about the underbelly of the Hollywood lifestyle, it still ranks as one of the best.",positive
42,A magnificently detailed portrait of Boston body politic with Mayor Marty Walsh as leading man.,positive
43,"An old-fashioned, white-knuckle adventure with the excellent Bridges adding another great characterization to his increasingly impressive resume.",positive
44,Perhaps this film does adhere admirably to the source material&#44; but if so&#44; it is at the expense of almost anything recognizable from the classic film&#46; This is Fletch&#44; without the edge&#46;,negative
45,"Kingsman is a frenetic, witty blast, and just the kind of fresh take an increasingly overly serious, borderline stale genre needs.",positive
46,"We've seen and heard variations on these characters several times before. Somehow, though, it seems to work.",positive
47,A botched supernatural thriller with only some fiendishly clever death schemes to commend it.,negative
48,Steep is a visually exhilarating sports documentary that is also more than a little exasperating.,positive
49,"Frankly, it could have used a touch more disrepute.",negative
50,"It's hilarious, though probably not to anyone who hasn't already been watching it on television.",positive
51,"As far as purely aesthetic experiences go, I doubt anything I'll see anywhere this year will beat Jean-Luc Godard's Goodbye To Language.",positive
52,"The movie is a polished muddle, fitfully amusing but with no spine.",negative
53,"When Woody's writing is solid, his direction is always at its strongest and steadiest, and Melinda and Melinda is sound indeed.",positive
54,"I am a fan of The Muppets and I'm glad to see them making a comeback. Maybe if this movie is a hit, they'll make a sequel where they'll actually get to be the stars of their own film.",negative
55,...another soulful story about adolescents careering messily into first loves.,positive
56,"Director Tony Scott is smart enough to focus most of the movie where it should be, on Travolta and Washington.",positive
57,None of Gordon Ramsay's kitchen nightmares are a patch on this.,positive
58,"Williams's bewildering, sinuous film encourages us to realise that getting lost is a destination in itself.",positive
59,"Its only aim is to make us jump, make us laugh, and send us off with a thrilling final shot that's everything a ""Cloverfield"" fan could want from a prequel.",positive
60,A touching ode to the rewards and challenges of female friendship...,positive
61,The special effects are jaw-dropping.,positive
62,There's nothing wrong with a little predictability and a comfortable presentation when it's a sweet and moving movie like 'Palmer.',positive
63,"What Catwoman: Hunted lacks in plot, it makes up for with chase/fight scenes.",positive
64,"What, might you ask, is the cause of all this cloak-and-dagger skullduggery? Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to bore you.",negative
65,"Most certainly, it will make you root for the Roughriders on and off the court.",positive
66,...runs on circle-of-life blather and Casio-keyboard songs by Phil Collins. To call it bland would be an insult to Barry Manilow.,negative
67,18 to Party is a thoroughly lackluster endeavor. Roda's awful screenplay deflates any value from this derivative half-baked homage.,negative
68,&#46;&#46;&#46;an exceedingly deliberate and predominantly uninvolving endeavor&#46;&#46;&#46;,negative
69,"She is woman, but the Helen Reddy biopic doesn't roar.",negative
70,A movie that could have been a fun summer escape winds up with a 150-minute identity crisis.,negative
71,"Sturges veteran Demarest is at his peak here, as is Bracken, whose desperation is hysterical.",positive
72,It&#8217;s on the lower end of Russell&#8217;s filmography in terms of memorability&#44; but is handled with such a light&#44; circusy touch that it&#8217;s not a bad way to kill a few hours&#46;,positive
73,"After a decade or so of suppressing his more lurid instincts, Oliver Stone is back in the bat-crap-crazy mode that made his Oscar-winning rap-sheet rep.",positive
74,Keira Knightley as Anna is supremely brilliant.,positive
75,"A little goes a long way, and despite the presence of the sleepily charismatic del Toro-his beleaguered Alejandro carries heavy baggage both in his heart and beneath his eyes-the Soldado man show does grow tiresome.",negative
76,"Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project reminds us that there is no such thing as objectivity when reporting on human behavior, and anyone who tells you otherwise is probably working for Fox News.",positive
77,"Occasionally pleasurable, but not entirely memorable.",negative
78,A damning indictment of the White House which concludes that 9/11 was less a failure of intelligence than a willful failure to act.,positive
79,"An artfully crafted film with subtle elegance, a moonshine drenched aesthetic and a set of performances that lift it well beyond many other Prohibition stories.",positive
80,"The film, at its best, is gross and silly and amiably unsettling, which may be all that counts.",positive
81,It feels like the middle of a trilogy&#44; but it achieves its goal of creating uncertainty for what&apos;s to come&#46;,positive
82,"From a director who's had a devil of a time lately comes a ""Twilight Zone""-ish horror movie.",negative
83,"If you're comfortable(or unaware) about the ambiguous origins of Drishyam, buy half a ticket to watch the second half. Or perhaps ask your friend's friend to watch it and interpret the plot to you.",positive
84,An overqualified adult cast and some fun moments can't entirely compensate for a defanged protagonist and too-static plot. This fantasy desperately needed a little more magic.,negative
85,"Parnassus is fun to watch a good deal of the time, and Gilliam is almost always visually surprising, but Ledger could have used a more momentous send-off.",positive
86,"As ludicrous and as unfocused as it all might be, Kong: Skull Island kept me amused for practically every second of its two-hour running time.",positive
87,"For all its fluffiness, Cute Girl sows the seeds of Hou's style, gesturing towards the realism and thematic richness of his later work.",positive
88,"If Mars Needs Moms had not have been produced using the mo-cap process -- which still hasn't fixed the problem where some folk have a spooky, neither-alive-nor-dead look -- it might have stood more chance of finding an audience.",negative
89,"a passable entertainment for kids that is hobbled badly by a formulaic plot and talking animals that, for the most part, don't have anything interesting to say",negative
90,"The NFL gets a ""special thanks"" in the end credits. Maybe it should have been the other way around.",negative
91,"Too much game, not enough heart.",negative
92,"The transformation of a fear-based man by a Zorba-the-Greek-like woman with a zest for life, enthusiasm, and creative daring.",positive
93,Tomorrow Never Dies brings non-stop action and thrills in a fun installment of the James Bond franchise&#46;,positive
94,"A somewhat charmless affair which, while striking to look at, fails to come to dramatic life.",negative
95,...a serenely crazed view of the present. The master is back.,positive
96,"This movie, if it is as successful as it deserves to be, might just open slapstick-happy moviemakers' eyes to the idea that kids will flock to a story that explores dark issues.",positive
97,"A pleasant enough diversion, The Hero ... nevertheless sinks into a mire of clichs from which it never quite escapes.",positive
98,"With a plot as unfocused as its freshly graduated characters, the shaggy ""Pitch Perfect 3"" gets by on karaoke logic: What makes for a good time isn't the song you sing, but the company you keep.",positive
99,The year's smartest and spikiest date-movie so far.,positive
100,"A serious treatment might have been more informative, but probably not as entertaining.",positive
101,"As true story-based, blue collar heroes vs. sniveling bureaucrats stories go, one of the better ones. (Splice Today)",positive
102,A fairly unremarkable crime caper that boasts production value and an impressive cast but is hampered by a sub-par script.,negative
103,Traffics a kind of superficial gender essentialism that makes its themes feel more didactic than incisive&#44; a reduction of thorny ideas to their most simplistic iterations&#46;,negative
104,"We may not have gotten the John Wick sequel we wanted, but it's entirely possible it's the one we need for now.",positive
105,Laced with comic romantic touches.,positive
106,"Extremely funny, well written and sharply observed comedy with strong comic performances from its talented cast.",positive
107,"None of the characters is emotionally complex, or very smart, or motivated by reasons more complex than the movie's paint-by-numbers screenplay.",negative
108,"Single dad's struggles are poignant, somewhat mature.",positive
109,The movie ends with the door wide open for a sequel; one can't imagine anyone involved jumping at the thought.,negative
110,Porn Star runs out of insight and surprises long before the closing credits roll.,negative
111,"Often gets bogged down in cliches, but Henson is just so good, and Najafi's direction so solid, that the film resonates in spite of its occasionally wooden dialogue.",positive
112,"First Snow is solidly made -- which, for this sort of film, is nothing to sneeze at -- but it doesn't leave that strong an impression either. It's a decent freshman effort.",positive
113,"...captures what it must be like to have your life suddenly turned around into total chaos, the hopelessness, the helplessness, and the despair that descends when thrown into a dungeon where people all around you are being executed on a daily basis.",positive
114,"The screenplay, adapted by both Kidd and Schulman, apparently leaves out much of the book's biting black humour.",negative
115,"Representa mais um esforço acima da média deste cineasta que, mesmo aos 74 anos, não dá sinais de pretender diminuir seu ritmo de produção.",positive
116,The funny thing is that this sounds more interesting than it is.,negative
117,"[Hugh Jackman's] a consummate professional, and that job often includes grinning through material that's beneath him and a little bit embarrassing. Director Michael Gracey's biopic of circus impresario P.T. Barnum is both of those things.",negative
118,"It's fascinating, absorbing and ultimately amazingly feel good.",positive
119,"Enough macabre interests to maintain an absorbing sit, but to reach a point of actual momentum, one must accept O'Malley's overly cautious handling of the feature's fright factor.",positive
120,"Itâ(TM)s designed to be crowd-pleasing and tug on hearts across the board, but thereâ(TM)s a manipulative quality that will put a ceiling on business.",negative
121,Woman in Gold is a David-and-Goliath story.,positive
122,"""Mank"" is exactly the type of film its troubled subject would have loved to make: a deep dive that basks in an era riddled with corruption, wastes no time exposing those who were complacent, and still finds moments to appreciate motion pictures.",positive
123,"The plot is ""ice"" thin and Ice Cube can't hold a candle to Van Diesel in my opinion. If you like a lot of car explosions and action packed scenes you will like this movie.",negative
124,"More contrived than clever, ""Stage Fright"" wants to be the musical version of ""Scream."" It isn't.",negative
125,"The film realises Raftopoulos's desire to deliver a film that looks as if it's been distilled from reality but in this instance, naturalism isn't enough. The judicious injection of a sense of heightened drama could have made all the difference.",negative
126,Mediocre A&C packed with corn and laughs.,positive
127,A sharply acted and highly entertaining morality play.,positive
128,"[The movie] has more integrity than its creepshow peers. The story basically comes down to a dead-looking woman who doesn't want to be a mother fighting for parental custody against a long-dead woman who does. (Grad students, start your theses.)",positive
129,"This picture is 115 minutes of nearly wall-to-wall actor impressions, and that does get to be too much of a good thing, unfortunately.",negative
130,"Starting at infantile and regressing hysterically from there, Step Brothers flies on the comic chemistry of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly.",positive
131,We are blessed with both the craft and the documentation of sublime empathy that Ali brings to the film,positive
132,"Maybe you see where all this is going. But even if you do, getting there is still good, queasy fun.",positive
133,"Despite a tacked-on framing device that mostly falls flat, Kevin Hart: What Now? proves to be a laugh riot thanks to the comedian's high-energy delivery and the broad spectrum of relatable topics he integrates into his set.",positive
134,"The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable, if not a pleasure in its own right.",positive
135,The audience has been delighted to spend some time with a couple of remarkable young ladies.,positive
136,This version lacks the occasional brilliant flashes of the first.,negative
137,"The film is no classic, certainly, but it's not one of those throwaway puff pieces, either.",positive
138,"After enduring a lot of jokes about May-December romances, Douglas comes bouncing back with one of his best performances.",positive
139,Carey's celebratory approach to bawdy one-liners marries form with content.,positive
140,"'The only truly interesting aspect found in ""The Core"" is Jon Amiel's thoughts as to what the inner parts of Earth might look like.'",negative
141,"Even at its most unbelievable, The Siege has the performances of Washington and Bening to fall back on, and a theme that understands that what's difficult is not choosing right from wrong but 'choosing the wrong that's more right.'",positive
142,Avoids many of the tragic biopic pitfalls.,positive
143,"Attack of the Clones is the best Star Wars installment since The Empire Strikes Back, hurtling along so quickly that you hardly notice the many moments when the story fails to make sense -- even on its own fantastical terms.",positive
144,Great comedic pairing. Good fun.,positive
145,"Effectively fashioned, as jolting as it is polished, as well as a surprising, insistently political work of commercial art.",positive
146,"Relish has a talented young cast, but Ward doesn't know how to use them. A laughably bad script tanks the entire experience.",negative
147,A soft-sell Nazi-era propaganda film that was used as a vehicle for its Swedish born redheaded star Zarah Leander.,negative
148,"Calvary, however, offers no redemption or even catharsis - at best, some talk of forgiveness - and McDonagh's crude drollery, if that's the word for it, feels forced, fake, as though anger is acceptable if delivered with a punch line.",negative
149,"Yet the images, and the actions within them, lack the acerbic edge that would really drive the knife in. Much like Brause himself, the film tends toward the handsome, yet hollow.",negative
150,Miller provides arresting visuals and attention to editorial detail&#44; but he can&#8217;t shake the coldness of the material&#44; which doesn&#8217;t reach the level of profundity the production is aiming to achieve&#46;,negative
151,"Altman's film strikes an English observer as the purest, possibly the simplest Americana, the kind of thing which it takes an American to know about, which nobody else can understand so well.",positive
152,"Gina Prince-Bythewood’s action flick stars a number of young actresses joining the ranks of Agojie, but Mbedu really kills it with plenty of stunts and an emotional tale of mothers and daughters.",positive
153,... a technically impressive but altogether listless revenge tale ...,negative
154,"Not completely successful, but enjoyable enough",positive
155,"A chamber piece cousin to The Ice Storm, The Playroom hones in on the mentality of so many irresponsible '70s era parents whose children grew up to be much better people than their parents.",positive
156,"...only Isaac and Kroll get the spirit of their characters right. Worse, the very core of Addams Family magic - the highly charged eroticism of the Gomez and Morticia marriage combined with their offbeat parenting skills - is nowhere to be found.",negative
157,"... Stiller composes an egocentric protagonist to ridicule, whose extreme sensitivity could also be his last chance. [Full review in Spanish]",positive
158,Bracingly chilly!,positive
159,The cast (and the costumes) are worth the price of admission.,positive
160,"Audiences will have to be content with the admittedly lovely Provence landscape and Ridley Scott's slick, superficial direction. Those searching for anything more will be sorely disappointed.",negative
161,"Big, glossy, entertaining if not exactly compelling.",positive
162,...relies as much on the evocation of mood as it does on things that go bump in the night.,positive
163,"It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement: Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems.",positive
164,"The animated shorts category is much stronger, with the two best coming at the art of 'toons from opposite quarters, aesthetic and commercial.",positive
165,"Salutes the vision that sees invisible things, cares for others, and refuses to abandon hope.",positive
166,The reputed world's most hated band is fighting the good fight.,positive
167,"Its' surreal and funny and at the exact same moments, sickening, verging on horror.",positive
168,"Sometimes, in spite of its blemishes, a film can make an impression. Heilstätten does this in the way it frames the whole piece, as well as presents the meta commentary within it.",positive
169,"A fanciful and enganging metaphysical mystery about a writer, two beauties, love and the challenges of the creative process.",positive
170,"Vigalondo may have made the most soulful film about gigantic, metropolis-smashing monsters yet.",positive
171,"A warm, winning, restless film...Beautiful, modestly progressive and heartfelt, with a wonderful, brash central performance from first-timer Waad Mohammed.",positive
172,I had no problem latching onto the two lead characters&#44; believing their feelings of loss&#44; and rooting for their inevitable reconciliation&#46;,positive
173,"I enjoyed it more than Spirited Away, because it's more straight-forward. This one is weird, but it's also grounded to human emotions.",positive
174,"Even when he threatens to fall into an abyss of navel-gazing, Antonioni never fails to offer up striking images.",positive
175,"The best movie about who gangsters are, and how they came to exert such a magnetic pull on American culture.",positive
176,"""The Lost City"" isnt a big movie, even with its big stars. Its out to provide audiences with an undemanding good time. Its a modest goal, but its one the movie reaches.",positive
177,Rushdie's script is faithful to his source novel to a fault. The lesson is that writers revisiting their work for another medium sometimes can't see the story for the words...,negative
178,This wonderfully dark story offers a mix of solid laughs and great scares and really brings this Stephen King novel to life.,positive
179,"Faster and, if possible, furiouser than its predecessors.",positive
180,Simply delightful in just how stranger than fiction it manages to be.,positive
181,The locations and cinematography are wow-inducing.,positive
182,"In a world full of remakes, reboots and sequels a truly original film has become like the sasquatch of cinema, a mythical creature long thought to be lost forever. Finding Everything Everywhere All at Once feels just like that - mythical and just magical.",positive
183,"It's all very charming, often amusing, and there is hardly a dull moment.",positive
184,"It's a delightfully bloody trip to a grimy, but melodic, Victorian London.",positive
185,"Epic in length only and peppered with sniggering homophobia, the homage to Himself drags on for three hours going on three years.",negative
186,"The Batman is a journey through the seedy underbelly of Gotham filled with epic action, unmatched cast chemistry, and maniacal villains. Everything that DC fans have wanted, and more.",positive
187,"The real stars of the sequel are the dinosaurs...But look out for the flying Pteranodons, which we see flying off into the sunset as a precursor to yet another unnecessary sequel.",negative
188,"Streep and Springfield make a surprisingly sweet pair of retirement-age rockers, but the scattered story line keeps losing the beat.",negative
189,"Wakefield's trenchant coming-of-age tale uses a classic pairing of utterly contrasting types to ground his exploration of innocence and experience, of complacency and the thirst for adventure...",positive
190,The best way to describe the whole ordeal is cheap.,negative
191,"Despite all the good is posits, The Boss Baby can never escape looking like a fake movie inside a real one - and altogether feeling like a redundancy.",negative
192,"With an arch wink and a nod, THE ASSIGNMENT dissects society's norms via its less reputable elements as cleanly and mercilessly as Jane removed Frankie's manhood.",positive
193,"The sincerity with which the clichs get served up, and so on, make a relatively smooth viewing experience. But they also render what would have been an at times harrowing real-life story into something safe and bland.",negative
194,"Director Chris Robinson moves his camera aimlessly, cutting in and out of speeches as if he were just as bored as I.",negative
195,"Reminds me of my favorite bumper sticker: 'If I knew grandchildren were so much fun, I'd have had them first.'",positive
196,"If you're sick of Hollywood teen movies that can't see past the end of their next tube of lip gloss, this Aussie alternative is well worth checking out.",positive
197,"This film reaches deep, asking questions about what's important, what real problems look like and what we are capable of.",positive
198,"Rapidly burnt by a volcanically ludicrous story, Pompeii rumbles and crumbles, over-baking itself into a frothy crisp--puffery on the outside and clichéd passions within.",negative
199,"Martin plays Clouseau as a cartoon. We always are aware of the distance between the actor and the character, whereas with Sellers, Clouseau was a part of him.",negative
200,"Makes you wonder whether Britain and China were wrong to allow Hong Kong to remain a free-market capitalist province--though the movie does not compare in quality to ""Wall Street.""",positive
201,Has the so-called Romanian New Wave slowed to a trickle?,negative
202,"Yes, there are a lot of in-jokes, but they are consistently funny, and Ralph and Vanellope have a gift for turning standard tropes sideways.",positive
203,"[Cage is] funny in his misery, because he has a natural air of exaggeration: he carries his own storm cloud with him, almost like a cartoon of the sad and lonely guys he played in Moonstruck and Raising Arizona.",positive
204,"Ms. Rao does have an ace up her sleeve, though: Prateik, who in his first lead role gives a nuanced, career-making performance.",positive
205,The movie is a masterpiece of editing &#40;by Sam O&#8217;Steen and Bob Wyman&#41; and the acting is flawlessly delivered by a brilliant&#44; tour-de-force cast&#46; ,positive
206,"Manages to be both moving and poignant largely because of the superb acting, cinematography and direction.",positive
207,"The film is so much fun that at about the 30-minute mark, I found myself wishing Werewolves Within was a TV series titled Welcome to Beaverfield.",positive
208,"...as futuristic visions go, Babylon A.D. actually gets a lot right...",positive
209,I found the extremely uncomfortable torture and gore fascinating to watch.,positive
210,"Another penny saver for Full Moon, and an unfortunate unpleasant one.",negative
211,"Taken 2, taken to where? Taken to the cleaners? In the original movie, Bryan Mills had 96 hours to save his daughter, in the sequel it seems like they have spent 96 minutes on the script.",negative
212,"As a film, Vanity Fair has a lot going for it -- including acting and energy.",positive
213,"This is not only the best Spider-Man movie that has ever been made, but it ranks on the top of the very own superhero genre. [Full review in Spanish]",positive
214,"As an avid hater of reality television, the intelligence behind James Ronald Whitney's Games People Play was quite a surprise.",positive

216,Certainly original&#44; often funny&#44; and occasionally even inspired&#46;,positive
217,"Not clever enough for Smith fans, not gross enough to compete on the Farrelly brothers' ground, the movie feels like a kind of self-congratulatory fake.",negative
218,Legion is hellishly bad.,negative
219,"A bona fide trash pastiche. So good it's bad, then? Almost, but the panache and playfulness machine-gun most of the shortcomings. DVD suppliers! Can we have the two films plus trailers in one now, please?",positive
220,"Olivier Assayas' three-part drama about Carlos the Jackal, the Venezuelan-born radical-Marxist terrorist of the '70s and '80s, is a rivetingly journalistic account of a scoundrel's rise and fall.",positive
221,"This lacklustre sequel to the 2015 hit Goosebumps hardly has enough jokes to qualify as a comedy, which leaves it stranded in the netherworld of near-horror, aimed at children supposedly not yet ready for the real thing.",negative
222,"Nope is a film of many ideas, competing for primacy in a script that somehow dodges being muddled -- and instead hits the screen as a cohesive and engrossing mosaic.",positive
223,The strength of the stylistic elements and Robbie's performance aren't sufficient to overcome the deficiencies of an initially derivative and ultimately off-kilter narrative.,negative
224,"It's probably best not to overthink a movie billed as a title fight between two of cinema's most iconic monsters, but as Godzilla vs. Kong pits these titans against each other... the results are surprisingly dull.",negative
225,Loving Vincent may not be unique but it's very special.,positive

669,Kaurismäki's delightfully delicate cautionary fable charts his unassuming hero's descent into an unforeseen nightmare of deceit and violence with a characteristically low-key blend of humane compassion and deadpan mordant humour.,positive
670,"Peckinpah's gentlest, boldest, and perhaps most likable film to date.",positive
671,"The first couple of acts of the Kendricks' latest, ""War Room,"" are so heavy on broad pulpit pounding that it's challenging to get swept along by the story's message.",negative
672,"Wrapped within this search for a pig is the bizarre underbelly of the culinary elite, insight on loss and the natural human craving for connection, and a complex bouquet of stark contrasts. The result is a totally unexpected, but utterly fascinating film.",positive

707,Put quite simply&#44; 2022&#8217;s Goodnight Mommy is a ghastly affair&#44; one that would be deemed awful even if it wasn&#8217;t being unfairly compared to the film that inspired it&#44; although &#8220;inspired&#8221; must be used loosely here&#46;,negative

711,It's an understated yet transportive film that beautifully articulates the way children perceive and process loss and grief.,positive
712,"Trading in pleasures of a deliberately rarefied sort, writer-director Andrew Dominik's talky, character-rich genre piece largely short-circuits thrills to sketch a grimly funny portrait of thugs taking care of business, in every rotten sense of the word.",positive
713,Superhero films are rarely imbued with this level of emotional resonance and gravitas&#44; and even though it doesn&apos;t reach the heights of the original Black Panther&#44; it&apos;s still head and shoulders above the MCU&apos;s other post-Avengers&#58; Endgame offerings&#46; ,positive
714,The round and round of emotions and passion is pleasingly akin to Mike Nichol’s Closer. Audiard’s decision to shoot in black and white deepens the emotional murkiness the three central players navigate.,positive

723,The yearning to become human again adds emotional heft to the gory dystopian mayhem.,positive

738,"Mortal Kombat is a deeply flawed film...However, if you're a fan of the franchise, you might well find some things to like here. It is bloody, dumb and bloody dumb - but sometimes, isn't that just what you're looking for?",positive
739,The movie's magic comes not just from Baker's ability to thread comedy into down-and-out margin-dwelling drama but showing how dependent people's survival is on each other.,positive

745,"An original story that just can't live up to the promise of it's ambition, ""John Dies at the End"" just isn't that good of a movie.",negative
746,"A misfire meant to be a franchise. The film is based on an old radio show, and the concept is interesting enough, but this movie just drags.",negative
747,"Pic relies on nerdy world-weary irony to carry the day, but doesn't convincingly draw its characters.",negative
748,All I can say is there's plenty of difficult people in Hollywood. We just aren't usually exposed to it. I think this film will speak for itself and the future of all involved.,positive
749,"Even the shoddiest of cliffnote 'authors' would be embarrassed over condensing a novel down to this elementary a form. Everything seems to work, but it's all too abbreviated to draw the audience in.",negative

751,"the story is just a set-up for the comedy, which Keaton executes with his trademark combination of perfectly timed derring-do and taciturn nonchalance",positive
752,"Deliciously dark and utterly gripping, this tightly-coiled teaser delivers disturbing answers to some very awkward questions.",positive
753,"For the comic actors, this project -- an enjoyable synthesis of improvisation and adherence to the original story -- seems almost too easy. You wonder why it took them so long.",positive
754,"Despite the thousands of miles which divide us from this little family in a far off speck of village, there is a strange community of spirit and understanding. And for this, Roy may take credit.",positive

771,"It's a daring, interesting and never boring film.  [Full review in Spanish] ",positive
772,"A modern love story filmed in a style reminiscent of glorious classic musicals, 'La La Land' emerges as a bittersweet treat for the eyes, the ears and the heart.",positive
773,"If the film is less than the sum of its parts, then some of those parts are touched by genius.",positive
774,"Executed more or less competently, though you get a sense that Gallo, aware of how thin the script actually is, is trying to apply a layer of Luc Besson-style Eurotrash tackiness to add interest to the otherwise flat proceedings.",negative

787,"Though the movie about a moronic NASCAR racer overall is uneven and Ricky Bobby's saga lacks focus, the stupid-comical banter and the lampooning of this particular brand of car racing proves entertaining.",positive
788,"Nobody plays ambivalence better, and yet, Plaza allows herself to seem vulnerable here. It's just the thing ""Ingrid Goes West"" needs to cut through that thick-skin ironic veneer of contemporary Hollywood comedy.",positive
789,"I liked the set-up and the mythology. The villain took me out of it a lot, but other than that, I enjoyed the ride.",positive
790,"Cheap Thrills is a thoroughly nasty piece of work, which doubtless will be the strongest selling point for this worst-case scenario about steadily escalating dares and degradations.",positive

805,Engaging and beautiful cinema.,positive
806,"An unconvincing, stilted adventure with a very '70s looking Lee Majors cast as a Viking leading his men into the New World while searching for his missing father. A low-budget AIP cheesefest that, at least, isn't as boring as 2007's Pathfinder.",negative
807,"Myself, I loved it -- as much for the self-conscious banality and surreal pointlessness of its dialogue, which unravels over the course of 11 more or less unrelated vignettes, as for its austerely retro black-and-white photography.",positive
808,"Without Nighy’s refined performance as Mr. Williams, Living’s lasting impact would be fleeting, but his embodiment of revival, despite incurable limitations, gives this film an unlikely opening to redemption.",positive

831,"Frankly, it's a pretty wretched story, but this small, cheap film has style to spare.",positive

850,A very unique and welcome cinematic experience.,positive
851,The most fascinating point made in the film is that it was Harryhausen who invented the way we all think dinosaurs moved. Those gestures - adopted as truth even by palaeontologists - first came from him.,positive

2925,The trippy last hour is jam packed with artfully arranged action scenes that manipulate time in increasingly psychedelic ways.,positive
2926,"A movie that ultimately has more cult than mass appeal, how much you enjoy Bad Lieutenant will probably come down to how much you like Werner Herzog rather than Nicolas Cage. A notoriously eccentric director, his latest film is nowhere near as mainstream",positive

2938,Slick. Stylish. Creative. Original. Beyond cool. A new day has dawned in the genre with Daybreakers.,positive

2947,Highly entertaining but ludicrous fantasy sci-fi film set in the 19th century.,positive
2948,"Despite its slickness, virility, occasional humor and, if it may be repeated, authentic professional approach, it is well-made but awfully familiar fare.",positive
2949,A poorly fit project for Roth who simply doesn't have the skill to invoke a lot of the nostalgic Amblin qualities that he allegedly aims for.,negative
2950,A solid thriller grounded by its compelling&#44; human protagonist&#46;,positive
2951,"With a whopping fifteen Academy Award nominations on her resume', and an almost guaranteed number sixteen thanks to her performance here, she (Streep) continues to amaze.",positive
2952,"Even if it doesn't convince us they're likely to conquer death before it comes for them, the film does prompt interesting debates about just how desirable an unlimited stay on Planet Earth would be.",positive
2953,"For devotees of gonad cinema, there may not be a better time to be had at the movies right now than the first 20-ish minutes of Seraphim Falls.",positive
